# JWT authenticated backend in go
## Goal
I love using solid but don't want to write a backend in JavaScript and can't use US-based
authentication services. Thus, I want to roll my own auth in a go backend to use it as a template
for future web-applications as well it integrate it nicely with a solid SPA.
